# Final Term Project 

Hello, and welcome to my final term project!
I decided to opt for the researcher path in order to go through a lab like project to run through the data I chose. 

I decided to look at social housing and police station data.
I wanted to create a map comparing where these houses are and where there is the most police stations in hope of being able to say that police stations are located near social housing. More details about the specifics about the project can be found in the actual finaltermproject.ipynb file.

In order to get to this project, you can use the mybinder link right below.
Once you are there, you can click on the finaltermproject.ipynb file to the left in order to access the data.
