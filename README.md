# Final Term Project 

Hello, and welcome to my final term project!
I decided to opt for the researcher path in order to go through a lab like project to run through the data I chose. 

I decided to look at social housing and green areas in Montreal.
I wanted to create a map comparing where these houses are and where there is the most green areas in hope of being able to prove that there is a lack of these green spaces near people who live in social home/near people who live off a lower income. More details about the specifics about the project can be found in the actual finaltermproject.ipynb file.

In order to get to this project, you can use the launch mybinder link right below.
Once you are there, you can click on the finaltermproject.ipynb file to the left in order to access the data. 

When everything is opened up, simply read the instructions and run through the code :)
